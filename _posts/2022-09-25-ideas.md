title: Sponsor Project Ideas and Brainstorm
---

### Ideas
Our idea is to create a fantasy sports(specifically football) website that focuses on presenting stats to users so that they can make decisions about their team. This is something that interests our team because we all like sports, and we play fantasy football, so we decided to base our project around this.
