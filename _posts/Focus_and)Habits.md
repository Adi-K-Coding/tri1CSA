## Graditude Note-Home
My mother. My mom is an amazing women who constantly goes above and beyond for my dad, my brother, and me. Whether its staying up late and helping us with
something or waking up at 5 everyday to get us all ready for the day, she always puts us above her, and for that, I am extremely grateful to her. She always
will drop everything to pick us up from somewhere, or make us a snack, or help us with homework. She has played a pivotal part in my life and I owe a lot of
who I am as a person towards her. I am grateful for everything that she does, and try my best everyday to make her feel appreciated and loved, just as she 
does for me. 

## Graditude Note-School
Ms. Naidu. Ms. Naidu honestly was a great teacher who always made sure that we felt welcomed. She was always understanding of our needs and constantly
adjusted to our many requests and needs, which was impressive for a first year teacher. She was always there to help us, staying well beyong the end of
school hours to help us. She would always make a quick joke that would make us laugh or offer up a suggestion that would make our code that much better. 
She is one of my favorite teachers that I have ever had, and I'm really sad that shes gone, as she helped further my love of coding last year, and I was 
really lucky to have her all three tris last year.
