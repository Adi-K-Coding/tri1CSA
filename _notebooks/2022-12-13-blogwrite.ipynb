    "The speakers were really helpful in giving us a lot of career advice for the future, whether it be in computer science, or in another field. They explained to us how the concepts and ideas that we learn in computer science class can be applied in all the aspects of our life. One of the biggest takeaways that they told that stuck with me was the idea that learning how to code is a way of thinking, even if you go into a field such as finance, or business. Once you learn how to code, you learn how to think critically, and this can be applied to so many different aspects of our lives. Thus, I was really inspired by this and this reinforces my desire to learn different languages. One of the coding/computer science specific things that stood out from the lecture was that machine learning and AI is really on the up and coming. Machine learning was a huge part of Mr. Porter's job and companies are starting to use it more and more to predict trends. This makes me interested in it and potentially wanting to learn more about it. Additionally, agile methodology is really helpful to learn because it helps you learn how to collaborate and improve your communication with your team members and peers. "
