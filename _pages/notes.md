# Extra Credit Monday August 29th Write Up

Computer science is not easy. It’s a constant uphill battle, but you have to keep trying. There is always somebody better than you, who knows more syntax than you, who understands thet theory better than you, who has better internships. Therefore, it’s in your best interest to work on your own stuff, and don’t get caught up in what other people are doing. Along the way, you’ll gain really helpful problem solving skills which can be utilized in all different aspects of life. Collaboration, and working as a team are both really important skills that we can gain from this class. Additionally, you can get a lot of cool internships at places such as Northrop Grumman, as Collin and his twin sister have been doing. 

Its really hard at the start, but keeping your motivation throughout the project is the greatest advice you can take to heart. Just keep trying and trying as everybody is gonna make errors, miss a semicolon, miss a capitol S in string, because we’re all students. Sometimes the theory behind computer science is some of the hardest things to learn, but once you get that, you’re set. Google is your best friend when it comes to syntax, as almost all syntax questions can be answered online, or by other people. On that note, working with other people is also a great tool for learning new things and studying. 

I think computer science is gonna be one of the most important industries in the upcoming years. Taking high school computer science classes gives you invaluable experience, and companies all across the globe are looking for people to fill their computer science dependant roles. And it’s not just cs roles that need cs, almost all fields and jobs need some level of cs understanding, or can be significantly improved with a cs background or implementation. Thus, computer science is going to play a massive role on the global scale in the upcoming years, in countless different fields.
